Monitor the response rates and behaviors of the recipients to gauge the effectiveness of the campaign.
Step 3: Interpret Performance and Deliver Training
Performance Analysis:

Analyze the results of the simulated phishing campaign, focusing on metrics such as click rates, submission of sensitive information, and overall employee response.
Identify patterns and trends in the data to understand which employees or departments are most vulnerable to phishing attacks.
Training and Awareness:

Develop a comprehensive phishing prevention training program based on the campaign results.
